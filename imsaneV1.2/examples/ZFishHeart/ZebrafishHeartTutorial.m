% In this tutorial we analyze a beating zebrafish heart. This involves
% extraction of a dynamic surface based on surface meshing, surface 
% partitioning and subsequent parametrization. We will also learn how to
% reorganize multi-layer data in a stack, and measure local tissue
% deformation by following a select group of nuclei. 
%
% Additional software required: Meshlab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net). 
%
% The tutorial starts by defining the experiment, and commences with
% loading a previously generated pointCloud, that is turned into a mesh
% using meshlab. 
%
% This is the most advanced tutorial, it is recommended to work through the
% basic ones on the drosophila embryo or wing disc first.  

%% Initialize ImSAnE project
%
% We start by clearing the memory and closing all figures.
%
clear all; close all;
%
% Setup a working directory for the project, where extracted surfaces,
% metadata and debugging output will be stored. Also specify the directory
% containing the data. 
%

% Start by creating an experiment object, optionally pass on the project
% directory (otherwise it will ask), and change into the directory of the
% data. This serves as a frontend for data loading, detection, fitting etc.
%
xp = project.Experiment(projectDir, dataDir);

% optionally switch working directory into the data directory.
%
cd(dataDir)

% Set file and experiment metadata
%
% Set required additional information on the files
% 
% We assume one individual image stack for each time point, labeled by time.
% To be able to load the stack, we need to tell the project where the data
% is, what convention is assumed for the file names, available time points
% and the stack resolution. Options to modules in ImSAnE are organised in
% matlab structures, that is a pair of field name and value are provided
% for each option. 
%
% The following file metadata information is required

% Specify the name and location of the meshlab script on disc. If there is
% no meshlab script, generate one using meshlab as follows:
%
%   Disclaimer: Meshlab is still under development and we noticed
%   differences across versions as well as operating systems. The below
%   description is based on v1.3.3 under MacOS. Generation of the script
%   should be very similar in the other operating systems, but differences
%   can occur across versions. We successfully tested: Win 7: meshlab 1.3.2
%   Ubuntu 12.04: meshlab 1.3.3Beta, MacOS 10.10: meshlab 1.3.3
%   
%   
%
%   Startup meshlab. (v1.3.3 on MacOS 10.10) 
%   In meshalb, import a point cloud 
%       -> File -> import mesh 
%   Select a point cloud on your disc in the dialog that appears.  
%
%   Next, subsample the point cloud by 
%       -> Filters -> sampling -> Poisson-disk Sampling 
%   and tick Base Mesh Subsampling. Default values for the rest are okay. 
%
%   Select the sampled layer under 
%       -> View -> Show Layer Dialog.
%
%   Now compute the normals of the point cloud by 
%       -> Filters -> Point Set -> Compute normals for point set.
%   Default values are okay.
%   
%   Now reconstruct the surface using poisson surface reconstruction at
%   default values
%       -> Filters -> Point Set -> Surface Reconstruction: poisson
%
%   Using different rendering modes, inspect the quality of the
%   reconstructed surface
%       -> Render -> Render Mode -> Wireframe
%  
%   To take on a convention on the orientation of faces (normals pointing
%   in the same direction), use 
%       -> Filters -> Normals, Curvatures and Orientation -> Invert Faces
%       Orientation
%   Untick Force Flip. Now all the faces should be oriented outwards. 
% 
%   To obtain a finer mesh, you can refine the triangles using 
%       -> Filters -> Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction ->
%       Subdivision surfaces loop
%   The default values should produce a fine enough mesh for our purposes. 
% 
%   Finally inspect and save the current filter script. 
%       -> Filters -> Show current filter script
%   Following the steps above, you should see the following list of
%   entries: 
%       Poisson-disk Sampling
%       Compute normals for point sets
%       Surface Reconstruction: Poisson
%       Invert Faces Orientation 
%       Subdivision Surfaces: Loop
%
%   Hit save script and navigate to the project directory (projectDir). 
%   Note the file name that you saved it as, e.g. heartFinal1.mlx and enter 
%   it below as a string in the variable myMeshlabScriptName;

myMeshlabScriptName = 'heartFinal1.mlx';
meshlabScript = fullfile(projectDir, myMeshlabScriptName);


% Now we create the mesh using meshlabserver and the just created script.
% Matlab has conflicting library defintions, which we resolved
% under Ubuntu and Windows, not in Mac Os. Here we will describe how to
% batch create meshes based on point clouds stored in a single folder using
% the clipboard and mac terminal. Windows and ubuntu useres can use the
% system command instead. 
% 
% Copy the command sctring into the clipboard. The syntax is -i for input,
% -o for output, -s for script name -om for options, here specifying that
% we whish to obtain the normals. 
command = ['meshlabserver -i ' PCfile ' -o ' outputMesh ' -s ' meshlabScript ' -om vn'];
clipboard('copy', command);
% 
% Open up the terminal, by going to the Finder, 
%       -> Go -> Utilities -> Terminal
%
% in the terminal, hit Command(apple) + v button. If all goes well, the
% meshlab server will start, producing the outputMesh based on the input
% point cloud file. 

% % for windows users : 
% pathToMeshlabServer = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\VCG\MeshLab\';
% cd(pathToMeshlabServer);
% meshlabServerCommand = ['meshlabserver.exe -i ' PCfile ' -o ' outputMesh ' -s ' meshlabScript ' -om vn'];
% system(fullfile(meshlabServerCommand))
% cd(dataDir)

% for linux users : 
% in case the following doesnt work due to a symbol lookup error: This may
% be caused by matlab system command using the wrong libraries or doesnt find libcommon.so.1.  
% In this case, set the library path variable in matlab to point to the
% right library. In Ubuntu this is done by copying the line below into the command window: 
% setenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH',sprintf(genpath('/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu'),getenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH')));
% pathToMeshlabServer = '/usr/bin/';
% cd(pathToMeshlabServer);
% meshlabServerCommand = ['meshlabserver -i ' PCfile ' -o ' outputMesh ' -s ' meshlabScript ' -om vn'];
% system(fullfile(meshlabServerCommand))
% cd(dataDir)


%% optionally for MAC: For dynamic surfaces, we may whish to loop over all time points
% This can be skipped for windows and linux users, as the system command
% can be used to call meshlab. Then the appropriate lines in 538-556  that 
% are used to process the input mesh need to uncommented. 

% bash script that can be called on the command line, that will process all
% point clouds in a folder. 

% In the example folder on the zebrafish heart, there is a script autoMesh.sh
% To loop over all times, the variable FILES in line must be updated to the
% folder containing the data. Replace FolderToMy Data in line two of autoMesh.sh 
%
% FILES=FolderToMyData/*
%
% by the actual path to your data. The MATLAB command uigetdir (enter in command line) opens a
% graphic interface, which you can use to navigate to the folder containing
% your data. Copy the output on the command line and replace FolderToMyData
% by this. Switch to the terminal as described above. Navigate into the folder 
% containing autoMesh.sh and enter 
%
% ./autoMesh.sh
% 
% This will loop the meshlabserver using the above specified meshlab script
% over all files in FolderToMyData. 


%% Read surface mesh produced by meshlab
% 
meshPermutation = [2,1,3]; % There is an axis permutation in the pointCloud, 
                           % that we need to take care of to have the
                           % surface axes match the data axes. 
                           
% read the output mesh, and crate a mesh structure. 
mesh = read_ply_mod(outputMesh);
mesh.v = mesh.v(:,meshPermutation); 
mesh.vn = mesh.vn(:,meshPermutation);

%% set parameters for atlas creation

% we build an atlas by dividing the mesh into overlapping submeshes and
% mapping those to the plane
% 
% ImSAnE creates two types of submeshes, both of which are created with a
% seed point on the surface as input.
%
% The first type is the Voronoi submesh:
% Given a number of seedpoints, the surface is divided in "geodesic Voronoi
% cells", meaning the submeshes are defined by all the points being closer
% to one seedpoint than any other, with the distance measured along the 
% surface. An overlap width between submeshes can be chosen by the user.
% By construction the Voronoi submeshes always cover the entire surface.
%
% The second submesh type is the disk submesh:
% This consist of all the points closer to the seedpoint than some user
% specified distance. Such a submesh tends to be less distorted because
% it has a very regular shape and can be chosen to be small, but it is not
% garantueed that choosing some disklike submeshes gives us complete
% coverage of the surface. Therefore, we may want to do both: create a
% Voronoi partition of the surface and create a disklike submesh around
% some point that interest us, such as the valve.

% Here we specify the rough XYZ position of where we want the seedpoint to
% be. These can be obtained by for example using the data cursur in the
% figure panel. 

VorSeedsXinit = [127 338 106; 311 290 110; 332 326 252]; 
diskSeedsXinit = [307 431 185];

% We then find the index into the mesh of the vertex closest
% to these positions.

diskSeeds = pointMatch(diskSeedsXinit, mesh.v);
VorSeeds = pointMatch(VorSeedsXinit, mesh.v);

% % Alternatively, we can just pick random points
% nVorSeeds = 3;
% nDiskSeeds = 1;
% VorSeeds = floor(rand([nVorSeeds 1])*size(mesh.v,1))+1;
% diskSeeds = floor(rand([nDiskSeeds 1])*size(mesh.v,1))+1;


% meshWrapper, as the name suggests, is a surface fitter class but rather
% than constructing the surface representation by fitting, it is a wrapper
% to work with externally created meshes
%
% we pass the mesh to fitSurface and that creates the submeshes that will
% be used for atlas creation
%
% The fitOptions structure should contain the following fields:
%
% VorSeeds:         seeds (vertex index) for the geodesic 
%                   Voronoi cells
% transitionWidth:  half-width of overlap between Voronoi cells
% diskSeeds:        center (vertex index) for disk like submeshes
% diskRadius:       radius of disk like submeshes
% makeTMaps:        boolean, should transition maps be made?

fitOptions = struct('VorSeeds', VorSeeds, 'transitionWidth', 50,...
                    'diskSeeds', diskSeeds, 'diskRadius', 150, 'makeTMaps', false);
xp.setFitOptions(fitOptions);
xp.fitSurface(mesh);

%%
% we can visualize a subset of the overlapping regions (indexing is such
% that disk regions follow Voronoi regions, so 1:3 shows just the Voronoi
% regions in this example
xp.fitter.inspectMesh(1:3);
view([0 0 1]);

%%
% we can also display a single submesh
xp.fitter.inspectMesh(2);

%% Inspect the fit in a cross section
%
% inspect fit and point cloud over a cross section in the data. Dimensions 
% are x,y or z and the value has to be within the corresponding axis range.

inspectOptions = struct('dimension','x', 'value', 300);
xp.fitter.inspectQuality(inspectOptions, xp.detector, xp.stack);

%% Generate the atlas

% We now generate the Surface Of Interest object, which involves building
% the atlas. The only type of chart currently implemented for meshes is the 
% conformal map described in the manuscript, which preserves shape but
% locally distorts size.

xp.generateSOI();

%% Create maps of the surface data
% 
% We call the process of creating the 2D maps of the surface data "pulling
% back the data" (in accordance with standard mathematical terminology)
% Calling the function SurfaceOfInterest.pullbackStack generates the Field 
% objects in SOI.fields that contain these pullbacks.
% The function is called as:
%
% pullbackStack(stack, ROI, time, onionOpts)
%
% Where the arguments are:
%
% stack:    Stack object containing the data
% ROI:      RegionOfInterest object containing affine
%           transformation from embedding coordinates to stack
%           ROI can be left empty: ROI = []
% time:     the time of the pullback, for storing in the SOI
%
% onionOpts: multi-layer pullback options, structure with fields
%   - nLayers:          number of layers
%   - layerDistance:    spacing of layers
%   - sigma:            smoothing of surface for layer
%                       displacement
%   - makeIP:           intensity projection: 'MIP', 'SIP',
%                       'both'
%   - IPonly:           only IP is stored as a field
%                       WARNING: this option will delete
%                       previously stored other layers if they
%                       were made
